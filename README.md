# Entropy Trading Engine

> **Turn Market Chaos into Cash Flow Alpha**  
> An experimental backtesting engine that transforms fundamentals (like free cash flow) and entropy-based signals into actionable trading strategies.

---

## ðŸš€ What Is This?
The **Entropy Trading Engine** is an open-source framework for:

- Collecting and analyzing market + fundamental data (e.g. cash flow statements).  
- Backtesting trading strategies with both **quant fundamentals** and **entropy-inspired metrics**.  
- Exploring new ways to model uncertainty and transform "market noise" into signals.  

This repo is **research-friendly** (MIT license) but also has a **commercial track** (see [License](#-license)).

Chaos is opportunity. Entropy isnâ€™t the enemy of marketsâ€”itâ€™s the raw material of alpha.
This engine is just the beginning. Help shape it.
