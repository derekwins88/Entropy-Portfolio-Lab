# 2025 Marker — Transitional Test

This document marks an **intentional pause point** in ongoing research and validation
work conducted during 2025.

The material present in this repository reflects a period of **transition between
multiple discovery paths**, where intermediate results were identified but not yet
consolidated into final claims.

---

## Purpose of This Marker

- To record that meaningful investigation occurred during this period
- To acknowledge the existence of partial results and open questions
- To preserve continuity without prematurely asserting conclusions

This marker is **not** a summary of findings, nor a disclosure of methods.
It exists solely as a reference point in time.

---

## Status

- Research state: **in-progress**
- Claims: **intentionally deferred**
- Verification: **ongoing / incomplete**
- Consolidation: **pending future work**

---

## Notes

Some paths explored during this period may later be:
- validated and formalized,
- revised,
- or discarded entirely.

This is expected and intentional.

*Marker placed to maintain historical integrity and continuity.*
